    <p>Hi! My name is Josh Fr&eacute;chette and I'm a student in the University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Coding Bootcamp. 
    I am looking to become a full-stack web developer, though I haven't decided which field I wish to pursue yet. I am currently working part time as a 
    freelance graphic designer and as a bartender/server.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am a high school graduate of a visual arts program at &Eacute;.S.P. De La Salle in Ottawa, ON and pursued part-time studies at 
    the Ottawa School of Art and Carleton Unversity afterwards. In 2008, I began the Graphic Design program at OCADU and graduated in 2012, with honours.
    </p>

    <p>
    In my free time I like to read, walk around the city, and watch movies. I also enjoy biking, snowboarding, camping, hiking, and basketball.
    </p>
